# Overview

Consider the following image which contains some data:

![PlaneData](Lab2Dataset.png)

The chart describes arrival delays for two different airlines across several destinations.

# Problems

**Problem 1:** Create a `csv` file that contains all of the information in the above dataset. You are encouraged to use a "wide" structure similar to how the information appears above, so
that you can practice tidying and transformations as described below.

**Problem 2:** Read the information from your .CSV file into R, and use `tidyr` and `dplyr` as needed to tidy and transform your data. In addition to providing code, please describe 
your data cleanup and tidying work.

**Problem 3:** Perform analysis to compare the arrival delays for the two airlines. What
are your conclusions?
