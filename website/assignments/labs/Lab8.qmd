# Overview

In this lab, we will use the advanced R programming concepts that we studied to process a 
complex text file for analysis.

**Problem 1:**

In [Text Mining with R](https://tidytextmining.com), Chapter 2 looks at Sentiment Analysis. In this assignment, you should start by getting the primary example code from chapter 2 working in an R Markdown document. You should provide a citation to this base code. 

**Problem 2** Extend this base code in two ways:

* Work with a different corpus of your choosing

* Incorporate at least one additional sentiment lexicon (possibly from another R package that you’ve found through research).
