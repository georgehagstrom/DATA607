    "text": "Instructor: George Hagstrom, Ph.D. Class Meetup: 6:45-7:45 Eastern Office Hours: By appointment Email: george.hagstrom@cuny.edu\n\nCourse Description\nIn this course students will learn about core concepts of contemporary data collection and its management. Topics will include an introduction to programming and collaboration in statistical software packages, data visualization techniques, data wrangling and transformation, exploratory data analysis and data quality checks, data acquisition from a variety of sources including databases and the web, tools for working with textual and graph data, feature engineering, and working with large datasets in a cloud computing environment.\nStudents will complete a project to create a working system for a large volume of data using publicly available data sets.\n\n\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\nBy then end of the course, students should be able to:\n\nLoad data into R from various data sources, including CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, relational databases, APIs, and web pages.\nPerform various data cleansing and transformation work, including splitting, combining; resampling; variable creation; data aggregation; sorting and filtering data; strategies for working with outliers and missing data; data visualization and analysis in support of data cleansing activities.\nUnderstand different information architectures, data types, and data structures.\nUnderstand relational and non-relational database design and querying.\nCover relevant ethical issues including data privacy and misinformation.\n\n\n\nProgram Learning Outcomes addressed by the course:\n\nBusiness Understanding. Apply frameworks and processes to build out data analytics solutions from understanding of business goals.\nData Culture. Embody and champion the highest standards for the ethical and moral use of data; understand issues related to data privacy and data security.\nSolid foundational data programming skills, using industry standard tools, essential algorithms, and design patterns for working with structured data, unstructured data and big data.\nData understanding. Collect, describe, model, explore and verify data.\nData preparation. Selecting, cleaning, constructing, integrating, and formatting data.\n\n\n\nHow is this course relevant for data analytics professionals?\nMost data analytics professionals spend most of their time getting data and preparing it for analysis. This is the course that teaches these key skills, as we work with both structured and unstructured data.\n\n\nGrading\n\nMeetup Reflections (10%)\nLabs (50%)\nTidyVerse Recipes\nData Science in Context Presentation (5%)\nProject (25%)\n\n\nGrade Distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuality of Performance\nLetter Grade\nRange %\nGPA\n\n\n\n\nExcellent - work is of exceptional quality\nA\n93 - 100\n4\n\n\nExcellent\nA-\n90 - 92.9\n3.7\n\n\nGood - work is above average\nB+\n87 - 89.9\n3.3\n\n\nSatisfactory\nB\n83 - 86.9\n3\n\n\nBelow Average\nB-\n80 - 82.9\n2.7\n\n\nPoor\nC+\n77 - 79.9\n2.3\n\n\nPoor\nC\n70 - 76.9\n2\n\n\nFailure\nF\n&lt; 70\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow This Course Works\nThis course is conducted entirely online. Each week, you will have various resources made available, including weekly readings from the textbooks and occasionally additional readings provided by the instructor. Most weeks will have homework assignments and labs to be submitted (although some chapters will take more than one week, see the schedule for details). There will also be a presentation required and a forum post introduction required. You are expected to complete all assignments by their due dates.\nYou are expected to attend or watch every Meetup. I highly recommend attending the Meetups live if possible but understand that may not be possible for everyone. Recordings will be made available by the next morning on the Meetups page. In addition to highlighting key concepts from each learning module, some topics will be discussed that are not in the textbook. Moreover, we regularly make announcements in the Meetups that will be important to being successful in this course. At the end of each Meetup there will be a short reflective exercise. These will contribute to your participation grade.\nEach students will have to complete one short “Data Science in Context Presentation”- you will sign up for presentation times at the beginning of the semester.\nThe culmination of the course will be the presentation of the analysis of a dataset of your choosing. See the project for more information.\n\n\nTextbooks and Course Materials\n\nR for Data Science (2e) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund. This is the primary text for the course. Available online for free at: https://r4ds.hadley.nz/\nHappy Git and GitHub for the userR, Jennifer Bryan. Available online for free at happygitwithr.com/. This is a short book introducing git and github from the perspective of the statistical computing and data science use cases, and showing how it can be integrated with R and RStudio.\nText Mining with R: A Tidy Approach, Julia Silge and David Robinson. O’Reilly, 2017. Available online for free at https://www.tidytextmining.com/\n\n\n\nAccessibility and Accommodations\nThe CUNY School of Professional Studies is firmly committed to making higher education accessible to students with disabilities by removing architectural barriers and providing programs and support services necessary for them to benefit from the instruction and resources of the University. Early planning is essential for many of the resources and accommodations provided. Please see: http://sps.cuny.edu/student_services/disabilityservices.html\n\n\nOnline Etiquette and Anti-Harassment Policy\nThe University strictly prohibits the use of University online resources or facilities, including Brightspace, for the purpose of harassment of any individual or for the posting of any material that is scandalous, libelous, offensive or otherwise against the University’s policies.

    "text": "Overview and Deliverables\nThis week is about meeting the other students, making sure you get a good start with required course software, and taking a bird’s eye view at data science workflows and the material that we will cover in the rest of the course. As such, the only official required assignments that you must turn in are to make a post on course Brightspace page introducing yourself, and to complete the meetup reflection (this is the same thing as the 1 minute papers of Data 606 if you are also taking that course). Howeer, you should also read the introduction posts of your classmates, perform the readings, and make sure to follow the tutorials and install the required software. Start early if you can with the software so we can sort out any issues asap. I’ll be monitoring the course slack page, which is the place where we will have most of our asynchronous communication during the course.\n\n08/28: Attend the initial course meetup at 6:45PM Eastern\nDue 9/01: Introduction Post in Brightspace Discussions\nSign up for GitHub and the course Slack channel\nComplete the readings of RDS (Intro and 28), the quarto tutorial, and up to section 15 in the happygitwithr tutorial\nInstall R, RStudio, git, etc (see the software page for more details\nSign up using the doodle poll for your data science in context presentation.\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nData Science Workflow\nCourse Toolkit: R, RStudio, tidyverse, Quarto, git\n\n\n\nReadings\n\nRDS (R for Data Science): Introduction, Chapter 28\n\nThe Introduction chapter will describe the workflow of a typical data science project and pave the road for the rest of the material we are covering in this course. Chapter 28 describes the quarto markdown language, which a flexible system for authoring projects and presentations that produces well typeset documents in a variety of file formats and integrates with a large number of different programming languages, so that computations and their results can be directly embedded and visualized in your documents. I suggest that you use quarto to create your homework assignments.\n\nQuarto tutorial\n\nThis is an official quarto tutorial.\n\nHappy Git and GitHub for the R User: Tutorial up through Section 15\n\nGit is a tool that allows a group of people to work together on a software project, enabling version control that allows differences to be more easily resolved. GitHub is a repository for software projects that integrates well with Git. Git is a commonly used tool, and is almost a requirement for teams with large codebases and more than a few people working on them. GitHub has almost been like the “LinkedIn” for Data Scientists and Software Developers. One of the goals of this degree program is to help you build a portfolio of work on GitHub that you can use to demonstrate your coding proficiency to potential employers. These tools can be intimidating because they have a steep learning curve, so I think it is important to start introducing them slowly, at the very start. There are many ways to interact with Git and GitHub, but this excellent book by Jenny Bryant focuses on the specific case of a Data Scientist working in R and RStudio. If you already know Git and have a good system, you aren’t required to follow this tutorial, but for those of you who are new to these tools this I recommend taking some time this week to get Git up and running and integrated with your RStudio installation.\n\nData Visualization: A Practical Introduction Appendix A1: How to Read an R Help File\n\nThis is another excellent resource on learning R, but the reading I’ve suggested here is an appendix which discusses the structure of help files. Being able to use help files successfully is a skill that separates novice and intermediate programmers from experienced ones, as help files often have a very formal structure that doesn’t read like a normal text document or piece of writing. This section can you know what to expect and how to get what you need from them instead of feeling frustrated.\n\n\nVideos\nHadley Wickham Introduces the Tidyverse\nThis course uses something called the tidyverse. The tidyverse is a series of packages that replaces much of the functionality of base R while at the same time giving the resulting R code a very different flavor. This course, and many of the courses in this program, start by jumping right into the tidyverse. This video provides an introduction to the tidyverse from one of its main creators. However, while this decision has some initial benefits, it isn’t without tradeoffs, so it is important for you to keep in mind that there are other, different ways to do things in R. We will explore some of these later in the class in the Big Data module and the Advanced R programming module.\nIf you want to read a little bit more about the trade offs of the different R ecosystems this is a short link:\nR Comparisons\nSpeaking with colleagues, the choice to use base R versus the tidyverse is quite polarizing, especially as you work in more complex projects.",

If you decide to go this custom route let me know and make sure to share your data, but I recommend sticking with the data I provided.\nYou can read the data into R using the command:\n\nnycbnb = read_csv(\"/home/georgehagstrom/work/Teaching/DATA607/website/data/nycbnb.csv\")\n\nwhere you should replace nycbnb.csv with the local path to your file.\nImportant note: It is generally not wise to include datasets in github repositories, especially if they are large and can change frequently.\nYou can view the dataset as a spreadsheet using the View() function. Note that you should not put this function in your R Markdown document, but instead type it directly in the Console, as it pops open a new window (and the concept of popping open a window in a static document doesn’t really make sense…).

Ask at least five people that you know (friends, family, classmates, imaginary friends if necessary) to rate each of these movies that they have seen on a scale of 1 to 5. You may use online survey software if you find it easier and want to generate a larger sample.\nProblem 2:\nTake the results(observations) and store them in a SQL database of your choosing. I recommend SQLite or duckDB if you are undecided. Describe the normalization scheme you selected for your database and explain why you chose it.\nProblem 3:\nLoad the information from the SQL database into an R dataframe. This is by design a very open-ended assignment. In general, there’s no need here to ask “Can I…?” questions about your proposed approach. A variety of reasonable approaches are acceptable. You could for example access the SQL data directly from R, or you could create an intermediate .CSV file. I should be able to generate the SQL table(s) and data from your provided code—if you use a graphical user interface to create and populate tables, it should have a mechanism to generate corresponding SQL code. This assignment does not need to be 100% reproducible. You can (and should) blank out your SQL password if your solution requires it; otherwise, full credit requires that your code is “reproducible,” with the assumption that I have the same database server and R software. Handling missing data is a foundational skill when working with SQL or R. To receive full credit, you should demonstrate a reasonable approach for handling missing data. After all, how likely is it that all five of your friends have seen all six movies?\nProblem 4: Is there any benefit in standardizing ratings? How might you approach this?\n(Optional) Reading related to this assignment:\n\nJames Le, “The 4 Recommendation Engines That Can Predict Your Movie Tastes”, May 1, 2018. This a nice backgrounder on movie recommendation engines.\nSteve Blank, “The Customer Development Process. 2 Minutes to See Why”, Jul 29, 2014.. In this [&lt;3 minute] YouTube video “lean startup” founder Steve Blank talks about the importance of getting out of the building to talk to customers. I’d encourage you to adopt this “builder mentality” in your own data science work whenever it’s practical, by collecting data yourself, whether it’s related to a “business experiment” or a “scientific experiment.”"

    "text": "The idea of this project is for you to find data and do something interesting with it that relates to the skills you have developed in this course.\nThe project is intentionally open ended- this is an opportunity for you to explore your interests, through using techniques or technologies that branch off those that were introduced in this class, datasets related to problems you face in your career or that you are curious about, or both.\nA great project will demonstrate a complete “Data Science Workflow”, such as the one introduced at the beginning of the textbook, starting from multiple distinct datasets from public sources (if you have a private dataset that you want to use you may discuss that with me), data tidying, exploratory data analysis, cleaning, hypothesis generation, and lastly modeling. This course has not focused on modeling and the mathematical sophistication of your model will not factor heavily in your evaluation, but by this point in the semester you will have been exposed to enough modeling techniques in other courses to incorporate models within your project.\nThe output of your project should software that allows me to reproduce your work and a research report which describes what you did with the data and your findings, which could be contained within a github repository. You will also present your project in a short presentation in the final week of the semester.\n\n\nThe first step of your project is to submit an initial proposal, which will help to ensure that your project is both worthwhile and feasible in the time frame of the last half of the semester. Your proposal should describe the area that you are interested in (and if you have a specific question already you can describe that too), the datasets you are going to use, and your data analysis plan. Your proposal should be a maximum of 2 pages (excluding figures and references), and should include three sections (each with target length 1-2 paragraphs):\n\nSection 1 - Introduction: The introduction should describe the motivation for your project, the subject matter area of your dataset, and any general research questions you may already have.\nSection 2 - Data: At the time of submitting the proposal you should have already identified some datasets that you plan to use in your analysis. Give a quick description of those datasets here, describe where the data can be found, the number of variables and observations, and/or the output of the glimpse() or skim() functions on the data.\nSection 3 - Data analysis plan: Describe your initial approach to analyzing your data. How will your datasets need to be processed in for your to make use of all of them in the analysis? Which sort of comparisons do you plan to make in your exploratory data analysis (you can share early visualizations of this is you have them)? What statistical methods do you think are appropriate to address the questions that motivated your interest?\n\nThe proposal is preliminary, and you can include additional data or a different analysis as needs require.\nThe grading scheme for the project proposal is as follows.\n\n\n\nWhen writing proposals, I’ve found the following set of considerations, called “Heilmeier's Questions”, to be helpful to consider. Although this is just a short project, you might find them helpful as well, and useful for formulating future projects and proposals that you might have to complete. These questions were developed by Dr. George Heilmeier, who was the director of DARPA from 1975-1977. Heilmeier said that every proposal to DARPA needed to answer these questions clearly and completely in order to receive funding:\n\nWhat are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon. What is the problem? Why is it hard?\nHow is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nWhat is new in your approach, and why do you think it will be successful?\nWho cares?\nIf you’re successful, what difference will it make? What applications are enabled as a result?\nWhat are the risks?\nHow much will it cost?\nHow long will it take?\nWhat are the midterm and final “exams” to check for success? How will progress be measured?\n\n\n\n\nThe emphasis of class has been working with datasets that have different types of variables and which are messy or often heterogeneous. For this project you need to select data that comes from multiple sources (there should be at least two datasets). You should be able to access the data and it should be large enough and contain enough variables so that multiple interesting relationships can be explored. A good starting point is that across your dataset, there should be at least 50 observations and more than 10 variables (exceptions can be made but you must speak with me first). The dataset’s variables should include categorical variables, discrete numerical variables, and continuous numerical variables.\nNote on reusing datasets from class: Do not reuse datasets used in examples, homework assignments, or labs in the class. Also do not use datasets exclusively from Kaggle or other sources of curated data for data science competitions (these have been made clean and tidy already).\nBelow are a list of data repositories that might be of interest to browse. You're not limited to these resources, and in fact you're encouraged to venture beyond them.

    "text": "When writing proposals, I’ve found the following set of considerations, called “Heilmeier's Questions”, to be helpful to consider. Although this is just a short project, you might find them helpful as well, and useful for formulating future projects and proposals that you might have to complete. These questions were developed by Dr. George Heilmeier, who was the director of DARPA from 1975-1977. Heilmeier said that every proposal to DARPA needed to answer these questions clearly and completely in order to receive funding:\n\nWhat are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon. What is the problem? Why is it hard?\nHow is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nWhat is new in your approach, and why do you think it will be successful?\nWho cares?\nIf you’re successful, what difference will it make? What applications are enabled as a result?\nWhat are the risks?\nHow much will it cost?\nHow long will it take?\nWhat are the midterm and final “exams” to check for success? How will progress be measured?",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Overview\nFor this laboratory assignment you will perform an exploratory data analysis on a subset of data from the Stanford Open Policing dataset. The particular subset we will be focused on is a record of stops made by the Rhode Island State Patrol between 2005 and 2015. This dataset is contained in the file RIOpenPolicing.rds . The rds file format is a compressed format that is much smaller than the corresponding csv file. You can load the data from it using the function read_rds.\n\n\nProblems\nProblem 1: The first step of an exploratory data analysis is to think of a set of interesting questions that your data set might be able to answer. This dataset has a large number of variables, so your questions can help you narrow down the questions you might be interested in. Write down a few questions about police stops that you might be interested in and list the rows in the dataset that you think might have important information to answer your question.\nThis is intentionally open ended, but if you need inspiration you could look at how factors like time of day, month, race and gender (of both the officer and subject), or department id are related to the frequency of stops, the reason for stops, or the outcome. For example one interesting question might be: Do racial differences in traffic stops decrease at night?\nProblem 2: Having identified the most important variables, you should study their variability, in order to better understand their distribution and to identify any potential problems with the data quality or unusual values. Calculate summary statistics as appropriate for whether you have categorical or numerical data and perform basic visualizations. Give justifications for the visualizations that you selected.\nProblem 3: You likely found that for some of your variables there were missing data, outlier values, or data points that indicate some sort of error. In order to continue with your analysis you will need to decide what to do with these. Modify your dataset appropriately so that you will be able to perform an analysis of the relationships you are interested in. In addition to the code, give justifications for your choices.\nProblem 4: Now it is time to visualize the relationships that you are interested in. Make plots showing how variables co-vary, faceting when necessary to explore relationships among up to 3 variables. Consier the following questions when you observe a pattern:\n\nCould this pattern be due to coincidence (i.e. random chance)?\nHow can you describe the relationship implied by the pattern?\nHow strong is the relationship implied by the pattern?\nWhat other variables might affect the relationship?\nDoes the relationship change if you look at individual subgroups of the data?\n\nIf the results of these initial visualizations inspire more questions, consider performing those as well. Briefly summarize the results of this exercise and relate it to your initial questions and hypotheses."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Overview\nThis is a two part assignment. In the first part you will use the webscraping package rvest along with functions and iteration to download data from the internet on political contributions. In the second part, you will use httr to interact with the New York Times website apis.\n\n\nWebscraping Open Secrets\nIn this assignment we will scrape and work with data foreign connected PACs that donate to US political campaigns. In the United States, only American citizens and green card holders can contribute to federal elections, but the American divisions of foreign companies can form political action committees (PACs) and collect contributions from their American employees.\nFirst, we will get data foreign connected PAC contributions in the 2022 election cycle. Then, you will use a similar approach to get data such contributions from previous years so that we can examine trends over time.\nIn order to complete this assignment you will need a Chrome browser with the Selector Gadget extension installed.\nIn addition to tidyverse, you will need to install and load the packages robotstxt, rvest, and scales.\nProblem 1: Check that open secrets allows you to webscrape by running the paths_allowed function on the url https://www.opensecrets.org. Then write a function called scrape_pac() that scrapes information from the Open Secrets webpage for foreign connected PAC contributions in a given year:\n\nThis function should take the url of the webpage as its only input and should output a data frame\nIt should rename scraped variables using the “snake_case” naming convention\nclean up the Country of Origin/Parent Company variable with str_squish().\nadd a new column to the data frame for year. We will want this information when we ultimately have data from all years, so this is a good time to keep track of it. Our function doesn’t take a year argument, but the year is embedded in the URL, so we can extract it out of there, and add it as a new column. Use the str_sub() function to extract the last 4 characters from the URL. You will probably want to look at the help for this function to figure out how to specify “last 4 characters”.\n\nDefine the URLs for 2022, 2020, and 2000 contributions. Then, test your function using these URLs as inputs. Does the function seem to do what you expected it to do?\nProblem 2: Construct a vector called urls that contains the URLs for each webpage that contains information on foreign-connected PAC contributions for a given year. Map the scrape_pac() function over urls in a way that will result in a data frame called pac_all. Write the data frame to a csv file called pac-all.csv in the data folder.\nProblem 3: Clean your downloaded data file for visualization.\n\nFirst report the number of observations and variables that your scraped datasset contains.\nSeparate the country_parent into two such that country and parent company appear in different columns for country-level analysis.\nConvert contribution amounts in total, dems, and repubs from character strings to numeric values.\nPrint out the top 10 rows of your data frame after completing these steps.\n\nProblem 4: Create a line plot of total contributions from all foreign-connected PACs in the Canada and Mexico over the years. Once you have made the plot, write a brief interpretation of what the graph reveals. Few hints to help you out:\nProblem 5: Create a line plot of contributions from UK companies to each of the Democratic and Republican parties over time, with the lines colored according to party to differentiate them.\n\n\nUsing the NY Times API\nProblem 6: The New York Times web site provides a rich set of APIs, as described here . You’ll need to start by signing up for an API key. Your task is to choose one of the New York Times APIs, construct an interface in R to read in the JSON data, and transform it into an R DataFrame."

    "title": "Lab 4: Data Transformations Studying College Majors",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The first step in the process of turning information into knowledge process is to summarize and describe the raw information - the data. In this assignment we explore data on college majors and earnings, specifically the data begin the FiveThirtyEight story “The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major”.\nThese data originally come from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2010-2012 Public Use Microdata Series. While this is outside the scope of this assignment, if you are curious about how raw data from the ACS were cleaned and prepared, see the code FiveThirtyEight authors used.\nWe should also note that there are many considerations that go into picking a major. Earnings potential and employment prospects are two of them, and they are important, but they don’t tell the whole story. Keep this in mind as you analyze the data.\nWe’ll use the tidyverse package for much of the data wrangling and visualisation, the scales package for better formatting of labels on visualisations, and the data lives in the fivethirtyeight package. Make sure to install and load these packages if you don’t have them already. When you load ‘fivethirtyeight’ you gain access to a dataset called college_recent_grads, which is what your homework will be based on.\nThe college_recent_grads data frame is a trove of information. Let’s think about some questions we might want to answer with these data:\n\nWhich major has the lowest unemployment rate?\nWhich major has the highest percentage of women?\nHow do the distributions of median income compare across major categories?\nDo women tend to choose majors with lower or higher earnings?\n\nIn the next section we aim to answer these questions.\n\nProblems\nProblem 1 Arrange the data by unemployment rate in ascending order in order find the major with the lowest unemployment rate. Hint 1: Use the select function to reduce the number of variables displayed when you sort so that it is easier for you to see the answer. Hint 2: to reduce the number of digits displayed in the unemployment rate, use the percent() function to mutate the unemployment rate, i.e. pipe your output to mutate(unemployment_rate = percent(unemployment_rate) )\nProblem 2: Which major has the highest percentage of women? Determine the three majors with the highest percentage of women using arrange. Again use select to only display variables relevant to the question and pipe the final output to top_n(3) to display just the top 3 majors.\nProblem 3 This problem explores the distribution of median income across different majors.\n\nPlot the distribution of median income using a histogram. Make sure to experiment with the bin width to ensure that your histogram captures the most important features of the distribution.\nSummary statistics: calculate the mean, median, 25th and 75th quantiles of the median income distribution using the summarise function. Qualitatively describe the distribution (shape, center, spread, and any unusual observations).\nPlot the distribution of median income for each value of the major_category variable using facets. Use group_by, summarise, and arrange to determine which major category has the highest typical median income, where “typical” comes from the summary statistic that you think best describes the distributions you observed in the histogram.\n\nProblem 4: Which major category is the least popular in this sample? Use the count function along with arrange to accomplish this task, and make sure you arrange in ascending order.\nProblem 5: Exploring differences between different STEM fields.\nOne of the sections of the FiveThirtyEight story is “All STEM fields aren’t the same”.\nThe STEM categories are the ones that match the vector\n\nc(\n  \"Biology & Life Science\",\n  \"Computers & Mathematics\",\n  \"Engineering\",\n  \"Physical Sciences\")\n\nUse this vector to add a variable to your dataset that is True if the major is a STEM major and FALSE otherwise. Then determine the STEM majors which have median salaries equal to or less than the median for all majors’ median earnings. Your output should only show the major name and median, 25th and 75th percentile earnings, and should be sorted in descending order of median income.\nProblem 6: What types of majors do women tend to major in? Create a scatterplot of median income vs. proportion of women in that major, coloured by whether the major is in a STEM field or not. Describe the association between these three variables."

    "text": "Overview and Deliverables\nThis module focuses on visualization, which is not only one of the first things you when faced with a new dataset but also the primary way that communicate quantitative information with other people. We will discuss principles of good visualizations and how to use ggplot2 for combinations of numerical and categorical data. ggplot2 is based on something called the grammar of graphics, which you will become familiar with as we build plots. Your first homework assignment, Lab 1, will be due at the end of this week. Your reading will also cover some of the basics of using R which might be a review if you already are an experienced user. Here are your deliverables:\n\n9/04: Attend the class meetup (finish the reading first if you can)\n9/06: Submit meetup reflections\n9/08: Submit Lab 1 on the Brightspace page for the course\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nData Visualization for Numerical and Categorical Variables with ggplot2\nLearn principles of good visualizations\nggplot2 syntax\ntidyverse code conventions\nBasic Data Transofrmations with `\n\n\n\nReadings\n\nRDS (R for Data Science): Chapters 1-4\n\n\n\nAdditional Resources:\n\nCalling BS: Principle of Proportional Ink\nCalling BS: Misleading Axes\n\nTwo good articles on making honest visualizations and identifying dishonest ones.\n\nFundamentals of Data Visualization. Claus O. Wilkey. (2019). O’Reilly.\n\nThis is my favorite modern book on data visualization, and it also uses ggplot2 as the primary tool.

    "text": "Energy Production over Time\nWe are going to display a visualization which shows how the energy generation in several different countries, specifically China, France, Germany, Sweden, and the United States, changed over time. It is possible to change the countries being visualized by changing the countries listed in the countries_included variable below replacing the iso_code labels with those corresponding to the countries of interest to you.\n\ncountries_included = c(\"USA\",\"DEU\",\"FRA\",\"SWE\",\"CHN\")\n\nWe picked a small subset of the variables available in this dataset to visualize, picking the ones that are most important for overall power generation and have greatest influence on carbon emissions, namely coal, natural gas (methane), hydro, nuclear, solar, and wind. These choices can similarly be changed by finding where they occur in the select and pivot_longer functions.\nSee the Appendix for a list of the countries and variables present in the data.\n\nplot1 = energy_data |&gt; \n  filter(iso_code %in% countries_included, year &gt; 1980) |&gt; \n  group_by(iso_code,country) |&gt; \n  select(iso_code,\n         year,\n         hydro_share_elec,\n         wind_share_elec,\n         solar_share_elec,\n         coal_share_elec,\n         gas_share_elec,\n         nuclear_share_elec) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(\"hydro_share_elec\",\n             \"wind_share_elec\",\n             \"solar_share_elec\",\n             \"coal_share_elec\",\n             \"gas_share_elec\",\n             \"nuclear_share_elec\"),\n    names_to = \"GeneratorType\",\n    values_to = \"Electricity_Per_Capita\"\n  ) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x=year,y=Electricity_Per_Capita,color=country)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth() +\n  facet_wrap(~ GeneratorType, scales = \"free\") +\n theme_classic() +\n  ylab(\"Share of Electricity from Different Sources\") +\n  xlab(\"Year\") +\n  labs(title = \"Change in Electricity Generation Share over time\",\n       color = \"Country\")\n\nplot1 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpact of Power Sources on Carbon Intensity of Electricity Production\nMany countries have set ambitious targets for reducing their carbon emissions. One way to visualize carbon emissions is to look at how much carbon dioxide is emitted for each unit of electrical energy generated. This measure called the carbon intensity of electricity generation. We will visualize carbon intensity in two ways: looking at how carbon intensity has changed over time in the selected countries, and also looking across the entire dataset and seeing how carbon intensity relates to coal power and the sum of all low carbon forms of power generation (nuclear, hydro, solar, wind).\n\nplot2 = energy_data |&gt; \n  filter(iso_code %in% countries_included, year &gt; 1980) |&gt; \n  group_by(iso_code,country) |&gt; \n  select(iso_code,\n         country,\n         year,\n         low_carbon_share_elec,\n         coal_share_elec,\n         carbon_intensity_elec\n  ) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x=low_carbon_share_elec,y=coal_share_elec,color=carbon_intensity_elec,shape=country)) +\n  scale_color_viridis_c() +\n  geom_point(na.rm = TRUE) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  labs(title = \"Controls on Carbon Intensity\",\n       color = \"Carbon Intensity\",\n       x = \"Low Carbon Electricity Share\",\n       y = \"Coal Electricity Share\")\n  \nplot3 = energy_data |&gt; \n  filter(iso_code %in% countries_included, year &gt; 1980) |&gt; \n  group_by(iso_code,country) |&gt; \n  select(iso_code,\n         country,\n         year,\n         carbon_intensity_elec\n  ) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x=year,y=carbon_intensity_elec,color=country)) +\n  geom_smooth(show.legend = FALSE, na.rm = TRUE, se = FALSE) +\n  geom_point(show.legend = FALSE, na.rm = TRUE) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  ylab(\"Carbon Intensity of Electricity Production\") +\n  xlab(\"Year\") +\n  labs(title = \"Carbon Intensity over Time\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Carbon Intensity of Electricity (CO2e / kWhr)\")\n\nplot3 + plot2;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting it Together\nWe can create the original compound plot using the following command (made possible by the patchwork package):\n\nplot1 / (plot3 + plot2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nHannah Ritchie, Pablo Rosado and Max Roser (2023) - “Energy” Published online at OurWorldInData.org.
