Additionally, I am a consultant with Princeton University where I development mathematical models of marine phytoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria to improve our understanding of the Earth’s Biogeochemical Cycles. Prior to joining CUNY, I was a Research Scientist at Princeton University in the Levin lab at the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and a postdoctoral researcher in the Magneto Fluids Division at the Courant Institute for Mathematical Sciences. My research interests include the application of Bayesian statistics and Machine Learning to incorporate nontraditional datasets (such as from ’omics) into mechanistic models of marine ecosystems and biogeochemical cycling, trait-based modeling, and critical transitions in complex ecological, social, or economic systems. In my free time, I enjoy cycling and exploring New York City.\n\nContact\nOffice Hours (Zoom is preferred): By appointment. You’re encouraged to schedule an appointment and I have time nearly everyday. You are also encouraged to ask us questions on Slack. If you wish to ask a question in private, you can email me directly.\nFor the most part, you can expect me to respond to questions by email within 24 hours.

    "text": "Instructor: George Hagstrom, Ph.D. Class Meetup: TBD Office Hours: By appointment abd TBD Email: george.hagstrom@cuny.edu\n\nCourse Description\nIn this course students will learn about core concepts of contemporary data collection and its management. Topics will include an introduction to programming and collaboration in statistical software packages, data visualization techniques, data wrangling and transformation, exploratory data analysis and data quality checks, data acquisition from a variety of sources including databases and the web, tools for working with textual and graph data, feature engineering, and working with large datasets in a cloud computing environment.\nStudents will complete a project to create a working system for a large volume of data using publicly available data sets.\n\n\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\nBy then end of the course, students should be able to:\nLoad data into R from various data sources, including CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, relational databases, APIs, and web pages.  Perform various data cleansing and transformation work, including splitting, combining; resampling; variable creation; data aggregation; sorting and filtering data; strategies for working with outliers and missing data; data visualization and analysis in support of data cleansing activities. * Understand different information architectures, data types, and data structures. * Understand relational and non-relational database design and querying. * Cover relevant ethical issues including data privacy and misinformation.\n\n\nProgram Learning Outcomes addressed by the course:\n\nBusiness Understanding. Apply frameworks and processes to build out data analytics solutions from understanding of business goals.\nData Culture. Embody and champion the highest standards for the ethical and moral use of data; understand issues related to data privacy and data security.\nSolid foundational data programming skills, using industry standard tools, essential algorithms, and design patterns for working with structured data, unstructured data and big data.\nData understanding. Collect, describe, model, explore and verify data.\nData preparation. Selecting, cleaning, constructing, integrating, and formatting data.\n\n\n\nHow is this course relevant for data analytics professionals?\nMost data analytics professionals spend most of their time getting data and preparing it for analysis. This is the course that teaches these key skills, as we work with both structured and unstructured data.\n\n\nGrading\n\nMeetup Reflections (10%)\nLabs (50%)\nTidyVerse Recipes\nProject (30%)\n\n\nGrade Distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuality of Performance\nLetter Grade\nRange %\nGPA\n\n\n\n\nExcellent - work is of exceptional quality\nA\n93 - 100\n4\n\n\nExcellent\nA-\n90 - 92.9\n3.7\n\n\nGood - work is above average\nB+\n87 - 89.9\n3.3\n\n\nSatisfactory\nB\n83 - 86.9\n3\n\n\nBelow Average\nB-\n80 - 82.9\n2.7\n\n\nPoor\nC+\n77 - 79.9\n2.3\n\n\nPoor\nC\n70 - 76.9\n2\n\n\nFailure\nF\n&lt; 70\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow This Course Works\nThis course is conducted entirely online. Each week, you will have various resources made available, including weekly readings from the textbooks and occasionally additional readings provided by the instructor. Most weeks will have homework assignments and labs to be submitted (although some chapters will take more than one week, see the schedule for details). There will also be a presentation required and a forum post introduction required. You are expected to complete all assignments by their due dates.\nYou are expected to attend or watch every Meetup. I highly recommend attending the Meetups live if possible but understand that may not be possible for everyone. Recordings will be made available by the next morning on the Meetups page. In addition to highlighting key concepts from each learning module, some topics will be discussed that are not in the textbook. Moreover, we regularly make announcements in the Meetups that will be important to being successful in this course. At the end of each Meetup there will be a short reflective exercise. These will contribute to your participation grade.\nThe culmination of the course will be the presentation of the analysis of a dataset of your choosing. See the project for more information.\n\n\nTextbooks and Course Materials\n\nR for Data Science (2e) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund.

These questions were developed by Dr. George Heilmeier, who was the director of DARPA from 1975-1977. Heilmeier said that every proposal to DARPA needed to answer these questions clearly and completely in order to receive funding:\n\nWhat are you trying to do?

For this project you need to select data that comes from multiple sources (there should be at least two datasets). You should be able to access the data and it should be large enough and contain enough variables so that multiple interesting relationships can be explored. A good starting point is that across your dataset, there should be at least 50 observations and more than 10 variables (exceptions can be made but you must speak with me first). The dataset’s variables should include categorical variables, discrete numerical variables, and continuous numerical variables.\nNote on reusing datasets from class: Do not reuse datasets used in examples, homework assignments, or labs in the class. Also do not use datasets exclusively from Kaggle or other sources of curated data for data science competitions (these have been made clean and tidy already).\nBelow are a list of data repositories that might be of interest to browse.

If you go that route, make sure to download the file listings.csv.gz for the city you selected (gz is an archive format which you should be able to expand), and you will only need to keep the following columns for this analysis:\n\n  nycbnb = nycbnb |&gt; \n    select(\n      id, \n      price, \n      neighbourhood, \n      accommodates, \n      bathrooms, \n      bedrooms, \n      beds, \n      review_scores_rating, \n      number_of_reviews, \n      listing_url )\n\nYou can read the data into R using the command:\n\nnycbnb = read_csv(\"/home/georgehagstrom/work/Teaching/DATA607/DATA607Lab1/nycbnb.csv\")\n\nwhere you should replace nycbnb.csv with the local path to your file.\nImportant note: It is generally not wise to include datasets in github repositories, especially if they are large and can change frequently.\nYou can view the dataset as a spreadsheet using the View() function. Note that you should not put this function in your R Markdown document, but instead type it directly in the Console, as it pops open a new window (and the concept of popping open a window in a static document doesn’t really make sense…). When you run this in the console, you’ll see the following data viewer window pop up."

Documents are written in plain text files. Formatting the document is done using specific markup. If you have used HTML, the framework is similar however instead of using &lt;TAG&gt;&lt;/TAG&gt; syntax, LaTeX uses \\TAG{} format. We will primarily use Markdown, and its extension R Markdown for preparing documents in this class. However, when preparing PDF documents, the Markdown will first be converted to LaTeX before creating the PDF file. As such, a LaTeX converter is necessary. There are LaTeX installers for Windows (MiKTeX) and Mac (BasicTeX). Alternatively, the tinytex R package provides an easier way of installing LaTeX directly from within R:\n\ninstall.packages('tinytex')\ntinytex::install_tinytex()\n\n\n\nSource Control\nAll course materials will be made available on Github which provides an implementation of the git open source version control system. RStudio supports git directly, but I recommend downloading Sourcetree. This is a free desktop client that provides an easier interface for working with Github. You will also need to create an account on Github.\nFor more information, Jenny Bryan’s Happy Git and Github for the useR is a free online book covering the important features of source control for R users.\n\n\nR Packages\n\nOnce everything is installed, execute the following command in RStudio to install the packages we will use for this class (you can copy-and-paste):\n\ninstall.packages(c('openintro','devtools','tidyverse', 'ggplot2',\n                   'psych','reshape2','knitr','markdown','shiny','R.rsp',\n                   'fivethirtyeight'))",
