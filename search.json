    "text": "Instructor: George Hagstrom, Ph.D. Class Meetup: 6:45-7:45 Eastern Office Hours: By appointment Email: george.hagstrom@cuny.edu\n\nCourse Description\nIn this course students will learn about core concepts of contemporary data collection and its management. Topics will include an introduction to programming and collaboration in statistical software packages, data visualization techniques, data wrangling and transformation, exploratory data analysis and data quality checks, data acquisition from a variety of sources including databases and the web, tools for working with textual and graph data, feature engineering, and working with large datasets in a cloud computing environment.\nStudents will complete a project to create a working system for a large volume of data using publicly available data sets.\n\n\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\nBy then end of the course, students should be able to:\n\nLoad data into R from various data sources, including CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, relational databases, APIs, and web pages.\nPerform various data cleansing and transformation work, including splitting, combining; resampling; variable creation; data aggregation; sorting and filtering data; strategies for working with outliers and missing data; data visualization and analysis in support of data cleansing activities.\nUnderstand different information architectures, data types, and data structures.\nUnderstand relational and non-relational database design and querying.\nCover relevant ethical issues including data privacy and misinformation.\n\n\n\nProgram Learning Outcomes addressed by the course:\n\nBusiness Understanding. Apply frameworks and processes to build out data analytics solutions from understanding of business goals.\nData Culture. Embody and champion the highest standards for the ethical and moral use of data; understand issues related to data privacy and data security.\nSolid foundational data programming skills, using industry standard tools, essential algorithms, and design patterns for working with structured data, unstructured data and big data.\nData understanding. Collect, describe, model, explore and verify data.\nData preparation. Selecting, cleaning, constructing, integrating, and formatting data.\n\n\n\nHow is this course relevant for data analytics professionals?\nMost data analytics professionals spend most of their time getting data and preparing it for analysis. This is the course that teaches these key skills, as we work with both structured and unstructured data.\n\n\nGrading\n\nMeetup Reflections (10%)\nLabs (50%)\nTidyVerse Recipes\nData Science in Context Presentation (5%)\nProject (25%)\n\n\nGrade Distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuality of Performance\nLetter Grade\nRange %\nGPA\n\n\n\n\nExcellent - work is of exceptional quality\nA\n93 - 100\n4\n\n\nExcellent\nA-\n90 - 92.9\n3.7\n\n\nGood - work is above average\nB+\n87 - 89.9\n3.3\n\n\nSatisfactory\nB\n83 - 86.9\n3\n\n\nBelow Average\nB-\n80 - 82.9\n2.7\n\n\nPoor\nC+\n77 - 79.9\n2.3\n\n\nPoor\nC\n70 - 76.9\n2\n\n\nFailure\nF\n&lt; 70\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow This Course Works\nThis course is conducted entirely online. Each week, you will have various resources made available, including weekly readings from the textbooks and occasionally additional readings provided by the instructor. Most weeks will have homework assignments and labs to be submitted (although some chapters will take more than one week, see the schedule for details). There will also be a presentation required and a forum post introduction required. You are expected to complete all assignments by their due dates.\nYou are expected to attend or watch every Meetup. I highly recommend attending the Meetups live if possible but understand that may not be possible for everyone. Recordings will be made available by the next morning on the Meetups page. In addition to highlighting key concepts from each learning module, some topics will be discussed that are not in the textbook. Moreover, we regularly make announcements in the Meetups that will be important to being successful in this course. At the end of each Meetup there will be a short reflective exercise. These will contribute to your participation grade.\nEach students will have to complete one short “Data Science in Context Presentation”- you will sign up for presentation times at the beginning of the semester.\nThe culmination of the course will be the presentation of the analysis of a dataset of your choosing. See the project for more information.\n\n\nTextbooks and Course Materials\n\nR for Data Science (2e) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund. This is the primary text for the course. Available online for free at: https://r4ds.hadley.nz/\nHappy Git and GitHub for the userR, Jennifer Bryan. Available online for free at happygitwithr.com/.

Chapter 26 will introduce you to a programming paradigm known as functional programming, which has distinctive strengths and weaknesses compared to object oriented and imperative programming and is likely to be less familiar to most of you.\nThere will be no lab assignment this week, but you will need to complete a short (~2 page) project proposal by next Sunday: Project Proposal.\nFor your reading assignments and more details about this week, head over to Module 8. If you can, complete the reading assignments before the weekly meetup on Wednesday. If you need help with with anything, don’t hesitate to post in slack or contact me directly.

The dplyr vignettes and articles are incredibly useful for learning about all the different functions available\nWe will use the TTR package (which is part of the tidyquant family of packages, see here). The main function we will use is called runMean. An alternative package that is also very nice but not part of the tidyverse is RcppRoll\nIf you aren’t very comfortable with logarithms, you should read more about them. They are one of the most important mathematical functions for data science. We aren’t using their mathematical properties much this week but they will be important throughout your data science journey. Khan Academy has a decent video, and this article in the journal nature has some more context.\nWe will calculate some correlation coefficients, using the cor function from base R (?cor to see how it is used). There is also a tidyverse package called corrr that is useful for calculating correlations on data frames, but we won’t use it for this lab.\nThe motivation for today’s assignment came from some news articles a few years ago about how big tech stocks collectively had a miniature meltdown after powering the stock market for several consecutive years, see this article at Morningstar\nThe wikipedia page on Market Impact has some references to Kyle’s \\(\\lambda\\), which we will calculate this week.\n\nProblem 1: The price of a stock on a given day only conveys information in relation to the stock price on other days. One useful measure is the daily return of the stock, which we will define as the ratio of the adjusted closing price on the current day of trading to the adjusted closing price on the previous day of trading. Read the following article on window functions in dplyr: window functions in dplyr.\n\nFind a function there that will help you calculate the daily return and use it along with mutate to add a return column to the data frame containing the daily return.\n\nHint: make sure to use group_by(symbol), otherwise your calculation might transpose prices from a different stock at the beginning of each time series.\nDifferences between the adjusted return and the return measured on the close price should indicate special corporate events such as dividends.\n\nCalculate the un-adjusted return using the same technique you used to calculate the return, but replacing the adjusted variable with the close variable, and find the datapoint in the dataset where the return exceeded the unadjusted return by the greatest margin. (Hint to check you have done it right: it happened in November 2004). The reason that the close price and the adjusted price differ is because stock prices typically decrease when a dividend is paid (to account for the cash paid out). The adjusted value has been modified from the beginning of the initial data record to increase adjusted to compensate for dividends. A dividend is just a payment that a company makes periodically to those who hold stock.\n\nIf you are curious: Look for an old news article describing the significance of that event and tell me what happened\nProblem 2: When working with stock price fluctuations or other processes where a quantity increases or decreases according to some multiplicative process like a growth rate (for example population growth) it is often better to work with the log of the growth rate rather than the growth rate itself. This allows standard summary statistics such as the mean to have a useful interpretation (otherwise you would have to use the geometric mean). Furthermore, the log transform is often useful to use on variables that are strictly positive, such as population growth rates or daily stock returns. To see why, consider a hypothetical stock which had a return of 0.5 (50% loss) on one day and 1.8 on the next day (80% gain). The mean of these two returns would be 1.075, or 7.5% per day. However, at the end of the two day period the stock would have lost 10% of its value (0.5*1.8 = 0.9). If we had computed the mean of the log(return) instead, we would have found that (log(0.5)+log(1.8))/2 = log(0.9^(1/2)), or approximately -5.2% per day, matching the observed price change.\n\nCreate a new variable called log_return which is the log of the return variable you calculated in the previous problem. Generate either a histogram or density plot of the distribution of log_return for the entire dataset. Then create a QQ-plot of log_return using geom_qq() and geom_qq_line(). What do you notice about the “tails” (right and left side/extreme edges) of the distribution from the QQ-plot? Are there visible signs of this in the density plot/histogram that you made?\n\nProblem 3: Volume measures how many shares were traded of a given stock over a set time period, and high volume days often associate with important events or market dynamics.\n\nMake a scatter plot of volume versus log_return, faceted by symbol to account for the fact that different stocks have different trading volumes. Do you see an association between volume and log_return in these scatter plots?\nUse the cor function to compute the pearson’s correlation coefficient between volume and log_return for each symbol. Why do you think the correlations are close to 0?\n\nHint: use it with summarize and don’t forget that cor is a base R function so you will either need to filter NA values for volume and log_return or appropriately choose the use flag in the argument- see ?cor for more info.\n\nNext compute the correlation in the same manner but this time transform log_return using the absolute value function. Recreate the faceted scatter-plots from the first part of the problem but with the absolute-value transformed log_return. How have the correlations changed from the previous summary?\n\nProblem 4: For this problem we will implement a more complicated mathematical transformation of data by calculating a measure of liquidity for each stock.\nLiquidity is defined loosely as the ability for a given asset to be bought or sold without a large impact on price. Liquid assets can be bought and sold quickly and easily, whereas illiquid assets have large increases or decreases in their price when someone tries to buy or sell them in large quantities. Liquidity is considered an important property of a well functioning financial market, and declines in liquidity have been blamed for worsening or triggering stock market crashes.\nMany methods have been invented to measure liquidity, but for this problem we will focus on a method called “Kyle’s \\(\\lambda\\)”. Kyle’s \\(\\lambda\\) estimates liquidity by using a linear regression between the absolute value daily return of a stock and the logarithm of the dollar volume of that stock. The time periods used to estimate this regression can vary, but here we will use daily returns and a one month time period (defined as 20 trading days). You will learn a lot about linear models in DATA 606 and other classes, but to be complete, \\(\\lambda\\) is a coefficient in the following linear model: \\[\n|R_t-1| = c + \\lambda \\log((\\mathrm{Volume})_t (\\mathrm{close})_t) + \\epsilon_t\n\\] where the coefficients \\(c\\) and \\(\\lambda\\) will be calculated to minimize the error \\(\\epsilon_t\\) over the past 20 trading days.\n\\(\\lambda\\) stands for the amount that the stock price will move in units of basis points for a given \\(\\log\\) dollar volume of trade. A small \\(\\lambda\\) indicates high liquidity, and a high \\(\\lambda\\) indicates low liquidity.\n\\(\\lambda\\) can be be calculated using rolling averages on the time series data with the TTR package, specifically the function runMean which when used within a dplyr pipeline will calculate the mean over the past \\(n\\) data points. For example, the command:\n\nlibrary(TTR)\nstocks |&gt; group_by(symbol) |&gt;  mutate(log_return_20d = runMean(log_return,n=20))\n\nadds a new variable which is equal to the mean of the log_return over the past 20 days. The mathematical formula for \\(\\lambda\\) is: \\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\mathrm{mean}(R_a\\log( p_c V ))\n- \\mathrm{mean}\\left(R_a\\right) \\mathrm{mean}\\left(\\log\\left(p_c V\\right) \\right) }\n{\\mathrm{mean}\\left(\\log\\left( p_c V \\right)^2\\right)\n-\\mathrm{mean}\\left(\\log(p_c V)\\right)^2 }\n\\] where to make the formula easier to read we have defined \\(R_a = |\\mathrm{return} -1|\\), \\(p_c = \\mathrm{close}\\) and \\(V = \\mathrm{volume}\\), and the averages have been taken over the past 20 days of data.\n\nAdd a new variable called kyle to the data frame by implementing the above formula for \\(\\lambda\\). Make sure to read and implement the formula very carefully, and to use the runMean function to calculate the rolling average correctly.\nPlot Kyle’s lambda for each stock over time (I would use a faceted scatterplot). What do you notice about how this measure of liquidity behaves (remember liquidity is high when \\(\\lambda\\) is small)?\nNext add a new variable to the dataframe called extreme which is true when the log_return for a given stock is either greater than 95% of other values of the log_return or less than 95% of all values of log_return. Use the percent_rank dplyr window function along with logical operators to create this variable. Then for each stock calculate the mean value of Kyle’s lambda for the days when the log_return had extreme values and for when it didn’t (as identified by the extreme variable). What do your calculations and figures indicate about liquidity during extreme events?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Overview\nThis is a two part assignment. In the first part of the assignment you will practice rectangling on a dataset from the repurrrsive package. In the second part you will combine the rvest package along with functions and iteration to scrape data on foreign linked political action committees from the website open secrets.\n\n\nRectangling\nProblem 1: Load the repurrrsive package to get access to get access to the got_chars dataset. In section 23.4.2 of R4DS, there is code that extracts data from the got_chars list and converts it into a tibble with information on each character and a separate tibble which contains information on the titles held by each character. Perform similar operations to create separate tibbles containing the aliases, allegiances, books, and TV series of each Game of Thrones character.\n\n\nWebscraping Open Secrets\nIn this assignment we will scrape and work with data foreign connected PACs that donate to US political campaigns. In the United States, only American citizens and green card holders can contribute to federal elections, but the American divisions of foreign companies can form political action committees (PACs) and collect contributions from their American employees.\nFirst, we will get data foreign connected PAC contributions in the 2022 election cycle. Then, you will use a similar approach to get data such contributions from previous years so that we can examine trends over time.\nIn order to complete this assignment you will need a Chrome browser with the Selector Gadget extension installed.\nIn addition to tidyverse, you will need to install and load the packages robotstxt and rvest\nProblem 2:\n\nCheck that open secrets allows you to webscrape by running the paths_allowed function on the url https://www.opensecrets.org.\nWrite a function called scrape_pac() that scrapes information from the Open Secrets webpage for foreign connected PAC contributions in a given year. The url for this data is https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/foreign-connected-pacs/2024. This function should take the url of the webpage as its only input and should output a data frame. The variables of this data-frame should be renamed so that they are in snake_case format (lower_case_and_underscores_for_spaces, see R4DS section 2.3). Use str_squish() to remove excess whitespace from the Country of Origin/Parent Company variables, and add a new column which records the year by extracting from the input url.\n\nHint: If you have trouble finding the right elements to search for using the selector gadget try looking for a table element.\n\nTest your function on the urls for 2024, 2022, and 2000, and show the first several rows of each of the outpus. Does the function seem to do what you expected it to do?\n\nProblem 3:\n\nConstruct a vector called urls that contains the URLs for each webpage that contains information on foreign-connected PAC contributions for a given year (combine seq and string functions). Using the map_dfr function from the purrr package, apply the scrape_pac() function over urls in a way that will result in a data frame called pac_all that contains the data for all of the years.\nClean this combined dataset by separating the country of origin from the parent company (use separate_wider_delim or another tool of your choice, you will need to be cautious with some special cases in this column) and by converting the strings in the total, dems, and repubs columns into numbers. Print out the top 10 rows over your dataset after completing these steps.\nCalculate the total contributions from PACs linked to Canada and Mexico each year and plot how these contributions change over time.\nFind the 5 countries who over the entire time period of the dataset have the greatest total contribution from affiliated PACs. Then calculate the total contribution for each of those countries for each year of the data and make a plot of it to visualize how the contributions have changed over time."

You are to answer two questions: 1) What was the most important thing you learned during this class? and 2) What important question remains unanswered for you? Our goal is to give you a moment to reflect on the most important concepts presented were and to provide me with information about what concepts are still unclear. At the completion of each meetup (whether attended live or after watching the recording), complete the Google Form linked from the last slide.\n\n\nSlack\nPlease be an active participant in the Slack channel. In addition to being a good resource for asking and answer questions, we hope you begin to make connections with other students. Contribute at least one resource related to data science that you find and think would be useful to your fellow students. Please post it in the #resource channel.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "The idea of this project is for you to find data and do something interesting with it that relates to the skills you have developed in this course.\nThe project is intentionally open ended- this is an opportunity for you to explore your interests, through using techniques or technologies that branch off those that were introduced in this class, datasets related to problems you face in your career or that you are curious about, or both.\nA great project will demonstrate a complete “Data Science Workflow”, such as the one introduced at the beginning of the textbook, starting from multiple distinct datasets from public sources (if you have a private dataset that you want to use you may discuss that with me), data tidying, exploratory data analysis, cleaning, hypothesis generation, and lastly modeling. This course has not focused on modeling and the mathematical sophistication of your model will not factor heavily in your evaluation, but by this point in the semester you will have been exposed to enough modeling techniques in other courses to incorporate models within your project.\nThe output of your project should software that allows me to reproduce your work and a research report which describes what you did with the data and your findings, which could be contained within a github repository. You will also present your project in a short presentation in the final week of the semester.\n\n\nThe first step of your project is to submit an initial proposal, which will help to ensure that your project is both worthwhile and feasible in the time frame of the last half of the semester. Your proposal should describe the area that you are interested in (and if you have a specific question already you can describe that too), the datasets you are going to use, and your data analysis plan. Your proposal should be a maximum of 2 pages (excluding figures and references), and should include three sections (each with target length 1-2 paragraphs):\n\nSection 1 - Introduction: The introduction should describe the motivation for your project, the subject matter area of your dataset, and any general research questions you may already have.\nSection 2 - Data: At the time of submitting the proposal you should have already identified some datasets that you plan to use in your analysis. Give a quick description of those datasets here, describe where the data can be found, the number of variables and observations, and/or the output of the glimpse() or skim() functions on the data.\nSection 3 - Data analysis plan: Describe your initial approach to analyzing your data. How will your datasets need to be processed in for your to make use of all of them in the analysis? Which sort of comparisons do you plan to make in your exploratory data analysis (you can share early visualizations of this is you have them)? What statistical methods do you think are appropriate to address the questions that motivated your interest?\n\nThe proposal is preliminary, and you can include additional data or a different analysis as needs require.\n\n\n\nWhen writing proposals, I’ve found the following set of considerations, called “Heilmeier's Questions”, to be helpful to consider. Although this is just a short project, you might find them helpful as well, and useful for formulating future projects and proposals that you might have to complete. These questions were developed by Dr. George Heilmeier, who was the director of DARPA from 1975-1977. Heilmeier said that every proposal to DARPA needed to answer these questions clearly and completely in order to receive funding:\n\nWhat are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon. What is the problem? Why is it hard?\nHow is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?\nWhat is new in your approach, and why do you think it will be successful?\nWho cares?\nIf you’re successful, what difference will it make? What applications are enabled as a result?\nWhat are the risks?\nHow much will it cost?\nHow long will it take?\nWhat are the midterm and final “exams” to check for success? How will progress be measured?\n\n\n\n\nThe emphasis of class has been working with datasets that have different types of variables and which are messy or often heterogeneous. For this project you need to select data that comes from multiple sources (there should be at least two datasets). You should be able to access the data and it should be large enough and contain enough variables so that multiple interesting relationships can be explored. A good starting point is that across your dataset, there should be at least 50 observations and more than 10 variables (exceptions can be made but you must speak with me first). The dataset’s variables should include categorical variables, discrete numerical variables, and continuous numerical variables.\nNote on reusing datasets from class: Do not reuse datasets used in examples, homework assignments, or labs in the class. Also do not use datasets exclusively from Kaggle or other sources of curated data for data science competitions (these have been made clean and tidy already).\nBelow are a list of data repositories that might be of interest to browse.

Each student will select a website API from the list of public APIs curated on this github repository. I recommend choosing a well documented repository which allows you to access data that you can load into R and visualize. If you know of website with an API that isn’t listed here, you may use it but be aware that this list is curated so there is a better chance that it will be easy to learn how to use the APIs on the websites listed here. I recommend choosing an API that doesn’t require authentication.\nUsing your selected API, you will create a vignette (in the form of a qmd file) using the httr2 library: https://httr2.r-lib.org/. This vignette should include three sections:\n\nA description of the API that you selected and the data it contains, along with a question that you are interested in exploring using the API\nCode that uses httr2 and other tidyverse functions which downloads the data you are interested in from the website and performs a simple visualization or analysis to address your question. Make sure to describe how your code works with the API.\nA conclusion section where you discuss the meaning of your visualization and/or analysis.\n\nYou should incorporate your vignette into a shared github repository which will contain all of the examples. I have created the following repository for you to use for this assignment:\nhttps://github.com/georgehagstrom/Fall2024TIDYVERSE\nYou should clone the provided repository. In order to push code to the repository, you will need to be added as a collaborator, which requires me to send me your github username (preferably over slack). You should also update the README.md file with your example. You may want to review Section 25 of Happy git and github for the useR. The github repo I have setup is to be organized following the first “ours” model.\nAfter you’ve created your vignette and uploaded it to github, render your pdf file and submit it along with your github handle to brightspace.\nIn several weeks, there will be a followup assignment where we will re-use the work submitted for this assignment and where you will select a vignette uploaded by one of your classmates and extend it by adding additional analyses.\nIf you have not yet done so, you will need to create a github account. There are many ways to work with git and R together, but one way I recommend is to follow the tutorial in the book Happy git and gitHub for the useR. To interface with our github repository use section 15.2 and create a project from an existing github repository."

    "text": "Part 1: Health Diagnostics and Diabetes Incidence\nProblem 1: Data Description and Outliers.\nLoad diabetes.csv into R and take a look at the data using the skimr package (make sure to install it if you don’t have it). Skimr provides a tidy summary function called skim. Use skim on the data frame that you loaded from diabetes.csv.\nSkim will list several variables. Pregnancies is the past number of pregnancies (this dataset includes women 21 years or older), glucose describes the concentration of glucose in the blood after an oral glucose tolerance test (drinking a sugary drink and measuring two hours later), skin thickness is the result of a skinfold thickness test taken at the triceps (upper arm), Insulin is the insulin concentration in the blood taken at the same time as the glucose measurement (Insulin is a hormone that transports glucose into cells), BMI is “Body Mass Index”, Diabetes Pedigree Function is a measure of diabetes risk based on the family history of diabetes for each patient (this is an engineered feature) and outcome is equal to 1 if the patient was diagnosed with diabetes with 5 years and 0 otherwise.\n\nSkim should show no missing data, but should indicate potential data issues. Do any of the percentile ranges (p0, p25, p50, p75, or p100) for the reported variables suggest a potential problem?\nFurther investigate the dataset to find potentially problematic variables using a qq-plot (geom_qq) or group_by combined with count and arrange. For which variables do you find repeated values and what are those values? Do you believe these values represent real measurements or could they correspond to missing data? Do the repeated variables occur in the same rows or different rows?\n\nWrite an overview of which values are missing and replace all missing values with NA for the next stage of analysis.\n\nPerform Tukey Box plots on each variable to identify potential outliers. Which variables have the most outliers? Are there any outliers that you think come from measurement error? If so remove them.\n\nProblem 2: Pair Plots\nUse the GGally package and its function ggpair on both the original dataset and the cleaned dataset. Which correlations change the most? What are the strongest correlations between variables overall and with the Outcome?\n\nRemark: This dataset has been used an model dataset for the construction of binary classifiers using machine learning and there are a large number of published studies showing these analyses. However, many of these analyses did not exclude the missing values erroneously coded as zero, as is discussed in this interesting paper by Breault, leading to highly degraded accuracy."

    "text": "Part 2: Car Crashes in NYC\nProblem 3: Finding Inliers and Missing Data\nLoad the NYC car crash dataset using read_csv. You can download the data from the course website by clicking here.\n\nWhich variables have missing data (use skim or another tool of your choosing)? Some missing values have a different interpretation than others- what does it mean when VEHICLE TYPE CODE 2 is missing compared to LATITUDE?\nLatitude and Longitude have the same number of missing values. Verify that they always occur in the same row. Check the counts of latitude and longitude values- do you find any hidden missing values? If so recode them as NA.\nMany of the geographic values are missing, but geographic information is redundant in multiple variables in the dataset. For example, with effort you could determine the borough of an accident from the zip code, the latitude and longitude, or the streets (not part of the assignment for this week). Consider the borough variable- what percentage of the missing values of borough have values present of at least one of zip code or latitude. What about if we include all the street name variables? What fraction of rows don’t have any detailed location information (latitude, zip code, or street names)?\nThe CRASH TIME variable has no missing values. Compute the count of how many times each individual time occurs in the crash data set. This will suggest that there are some inliers in the data. Compute summary statistics on the count data, and determine how many inliers there are (define an inlier as a data value where the count is an outlier, i.e. the count of that value is greater than 1.5*IQR + P75, i.e. 1.5 times the interquartile range past the 75th percentile for the distribution of counts for values of that variable.) For which inliers do you believe the time is most likely to be accurate? For which is it least likely to be accurate and why do you think so?\n\nProblem 4: Finding Patterns in the Data\nFormulate a question about crash data in NYC and make visualizations to explore your question. It could be related to the geographical distribution of accidents, the timing of accidents, which types of vehicles lead to more or less dangerous accidents, or anything else you want. Write comments/notes describing your observations in each visualizations you create and mention how these observations impact your initial hypotheses.\nUseful questions to consider when you observe a pattern:\n\nCould this pattern be due to coincidence (i.e. random chance)?\nHow can you describe the relationship implied by the pattern?\nHow strong is the relationship implied by the pattern?\nWhat other variables might affect the relationship?\nDoes the relationship change if you look at individual subgroups of the data?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Overview\nThis lab is divided into two parts. In the first part you will practice using joins for data wrangling and analysis on the nycflights dataset. Some of the problems come from Chapter 19 of your book. For the second part, you will download a dataset on the budgets of college sports programs and process it for storage in a relational database (I strongly recommend using duckdb which can be installed using install.packages(\"duckdb\")- duckdb is highly performant, self-contained, and ideally suited both to learning SQL and performing data analysis). Then you will load this database and use dbplyr to perform an analysis. You will also practice using forcats to recode some of the variables as factors (which are supported by duckdb) and using separate_wider_delim to split columns of text data.\nYou will need to have installed and to the following libraries:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(DBI)\nlibrary(duckdb)\nlibrary(nycflights13)\n\n\n\nProblems\nPart I: Airline Flight Delays\nFor the first part of this lab exercise, we will be using the nycflights library, which contains several different built in datasets including planes, which has information on each plane that appears in the data; flights, which has information on individual flights; airports, which has information on individual airports; and weather, which has information on the weather that the origin airports. In order to do this set of lab exercises, you will need to use different types of joins to combine variables in each data frame.\nProblem 1\n\nUse the flights and planes tables to compute the mean departure delay of each aircraft that has more than 30 recorded flights in the dataset. Hint: Make note of the fact that the variable year appears in both flights and planes but means different things in each before performing any joins.\nUse anti-join to identify flights where tailnum does not have a match in plane. Determine the carriers for which this problem is the most common.\nFind the airplane model which made the most flights in the dataset, and filter the dataset to contain only flights flown by airplanes of that model, adding a variable which corresponds to the year each those airplanes were built. Then compute the average departure delay for each year of origin and plot the data. Is there any evidence that older planes have more greater departure delays?\n\nProblem 2\n\nCompute the average delay by destination, then join on the airports data frame so you can show the spatial distribution of delays. Here’s an easy way to draw a map of the United States:\n\n\nairports |&gt;\n  semi_join(flights, join_by(faa == dest)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = lon, y = lat)) +\n    borders(\"state\") +\n    geom_point() +\n    coord_quickmap()\n\nYou might want to use the size or color of the points to display the average delay for each airport.\nPart II: Creating and Accessing a Database \nIn this exercise we will begin with a flat file which contains data on college sports programs throughout the country. The source of the data is a government run database called Equity in Athletics Data Analysis, though we are working with just a small subset here. You can download this file by clicking here: sports_program_costs.csv. I have also included a data dictionary which gives a quick description of the dataset, which can be downloaded from here: sports_program_data_dictionary.qmd. This file contains information on two types of entities: sports teams and universities, however the information on both entities is combined into a single table, creating substantial redundancies. This exercise has several goals:\n\nLoad this data into R, split the dataframe into two dataframes, one corresponding to colleges and another corresponding to sports teams, related to each other by common keys. Many databases are stored according to normalization rules, which are designed to limit redundancy and to make it easier to both work with the data and make changes to it. By splitting the data frame we will partially normalize it (but won’t go too far).\nCreate a relational database using duckdb which contains these two tables.\nRead this database into R and a/an SQL query/queries to perform an analysis.\n\nProblem 3:\n\nsports_program_data.csv contains variables which either describe properties of a sports team or a college. Split sports_programs_data into two data frames, one called colleges and another called teams. How can you tell which variables describe colleges and which describe teams? Use the data dictionary and observations of how the values vary as you move from college to college to help make the decision easier. Make sure there are primary keys for both the colleges and teams data frames (verify with count)- what are the primary keys in each case and are they simple keys (one variable) or compound keys (require multiple variables). One of these data-sets should contain a foreign key- which one has it and what variables comprise it?\nThe variable sector_name contains information about whether a college is public, private, non-profit, for-profit, a 2-year college, or a 4-year + college. Split this variable (using separate_wider_delim) into two variables, one of which describes whether the college is a Public, Private nonprofit, or private for-profit, and another which describes how many years the college programs run.\nSeveral variables are candidates to be recoded as factors, for example state_cd, zip_text, classification_name, sports, and the sector variables you just created for the previous part. Recode these variables as categorical variables. For the classification variable, use the classification_code to order the factors according to the numeric code.\n\nProblem 4\n\nUsing DBI, duckdb, and dbplyr, create a relational database with two tables, writing the sports data frame you created in problem 3 to one and the colleges data frame (also from problem 3) to the other. Write this database to disk. How does the size of the database file compare to the original csv?\nUse dbplyr to write a query to this database that calculates the top 10 colleges ranked by the average profit (defined as revenue - expenses) of their american football team over the years of data. Print the SQL query that results from your R pipeline using show_query() and then use collect() to show the results of this query."

    "text": "Overview and Deliverables\nThis week is about meeting the other students, making sure you get a good start with required course software, and taking a bird’s eye view at data science workflows and the material that we will cover in the rest of the course. As such, the only official required assignments that you must turn in are to make a post on course Brightspace page introducing yourself, and to complete the meetup reflection (this is the same thing as the 1 minute papers of Data 606 if you are also taking that course). Howeer, you should also read the introduction posts of your classmates, perform the readings, and make sure to follow the tutorials and install the required software. Start early if you can with the software so we can sort out any issues asap. I’ll be monitoring the course slack page, which is the place where we will have most of our asynchronous communication during the course.\n\n08/28: Attend the initial course meetup at 6:45PM Eastern\nDue 9/01: Introduction Post in Brightspace Discussions\nSign up for GitHub and the course Slack channel\nComplete the readings of RDS (Intro and 28), the quarto tutorial, and up to section 15 in the happygitwithr tutorial\nInstall R, RStudio, git, etc (see the software page for more details\nSign up using the doodle poll for your data science in context presentation.\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nData Science Workflow\nCourse Toolkit: R, RStudio, tidyverse, Quarto, git\n\n\n\nReadings\n\nRDS (R for Data Science): Introduction, Chapter 28\n\nThe Introduction chapter will describe the workflow of a typical data science project and pave the road for the rest of the material we are covering in this course. Chapter 28 describes the quarto markdown language, which a flexible system for authoring projects and presentations that produces well typeset documents in a variety of file formats and integrates with a large number of different programming languages, so that computations and their results can be directly embedded and visualized in your documents. I suggest that you use quarto to create your homework assignments.\n\nQuarto tutorial\n\nThis is an official quarto tutorial.\n\nHappy Git and GitHub for the R User: Tutorial up through Section 15\n\nGit is a tool that allows a group of people to work together on a software project, enabling version control that allows differences to be more easily resolved. GitHub is a repository for software projects that integrates well with Git. Git is a commonly used tool, and is almost a requirement for teams with large codebases and more than a few people working on them. GitHub has almost been like the “LinkedIn” for Data Scientists and Software Developers. One of the goals of this degree program is to help you build a portfolio of work on GitHub that you can use to demonstrate your coding proficiency to potential employers. These tools can be intimidating because they have a steep learning curve, so I think it is important to start introducing them slowly, at the very start. There are many ways to interact with Git and GitHub, but this excellent book by Jenny Bryant focuses on the specific case of a Data Scientist working in R and RStudio. If you already know Git and have a good system, you aren’t required to follow this tutorial, but for those of you who are new to these tools this I recommend taking some time this week to get Git up and running and integrated with your RStudio installation.\n\nData Visualization: A Practical Introduction Appendix A1: How to Read an R Help File\n\nThis is another excellent resource on learning R, but the reading I’ve suggested here is an appendix which discusses the structure of help files. Being able to use help files successfully is a skill that separates novice and intermediate programmers from experienced ones, as help files often have a very formal structure that doesn’t read like a normal text document or piece of writing. This section can you know what to expect and how to get what you need from them instead of feeling frustrated.\n\n\nVideos\nHadley Wickham Introduces the Tidyverse\nThis course uses something called the tidyverse. The tidyverse is a series of packages that replaces much of the functionality of base R while at the same time giving the resulting R code a very different flavor. This course, and many of the courses in this program, start by jumping right into the tidyverse. This video provides an introduction to the tidyverse from one of its main creators. However, while this decision has some initial benefits, it isn’t without tradeoffs, so it is important for you to keep in mind that there are other, different ways to do things in R. We will explore some of these later in the class in the Big Data module and the Advanced R programming module.\nIf you want to read a little bit more about the trade offs of the different R ecosystems this is a short link:\nR Comparisons\nSpeaking with colleagues, the choice to use base R versus the tidyverse is quite polarizing, especially as you work in more complex projects.",

The discussion of keys and joins will lead in to an introduction to relational databases, which are one of the most common ways for large organizations to store data. We will talk about the trade-offs of using databases versus other data storage schemes and introduce SQL (the most common standard for languages that access and modify databases) through R packages DBI and dbplyr and duckdb, which is a relational database system designed for data analysis and portability and which is also easy to learn from. In the first weeks of this program we have discussed how R and python are two required languages for data scientists to have proficiency in. SQL and databases are equally important.\nYou will have a lab assignment titled R and SQL due next Sunday at midnight.\nFor your reading assignments and more details about this week, head over to Module 7.
