    "text": "George Hagstrom, Ph.D.\nEmail: george.hagstrom@cuny.edu\nI am currently a Doctoral Lecturer in Data Science and Information Systems at the City University of New York. Additionally, I am a consultant with Princeton University where I development mathematical models of marine phytoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria to improve our understanding of the Earth’s Biogeochemical Cycles. Prior to joining CUNY, I was a Research Scientist at Princeton University in the Levin lab at the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and a postdoctoral researcher in the Magneto Fluids Division at the Courant Institute for Mathematical Sciences. My research interests include the application of Bayesian statistics and Machine Learning to incorporate nontraditional datasets (such as from ’omics) into mechanistic models of marine ecosystems and biogeochemical cycling, trait-based modeling, and critical transitions in complex ecological, social, or economic systems. In my free time, I enjoy cycling and exploring New York City.\n\nContact\nOffice Hours (Zoom is preferred): By appointment. You’re encouraged to schedule an appointment and I have time nearly everyday. You are also encouraged to ask us questions on Slack. If you wish to ask a question in private, you can email me directly.\nFor the most part, you can expect me to respond to questions by email within 24 hours. If you do not hear back from me within 48 hours of sending an email, please resend your message. I will be checking in on the course regularly, just about every day and likely several times each day.

    "text": "Instructor: George Hagstrom, Ph.D. Class Meetup: TBD Office Hours: By appointment abd TBD Email: george.hagstrom@cuny.edu\n\nCourse Description\nIn this course students will learn about core concepts of contemporary data collection and its management. Topics will include an introduction to programming and collaboration in statistical software packages, data visualization techniques, data wrangling and transformation, exploratory data analysis and data quality checks, data acquisition from a variety of sources including databases and the web, tools for working with textual and graph data, feature engineering, and working with large datasets in a cloud computing environment.\nStudents will complete a project to create a working system for a large volume of data using publicly available data sets.\n\n\nCourse Learning Outcomes:\nBy then end of the course, students should be able to:\nLoad data into R from various data sources, including CSV files, Excel spreadsheets, relational databases, APIs, and web pages.  Perform various data cleansing and transformation work, including splitting, combining; resampling; variable creation; data aggregation; sorting and filtering data; strategies for working with outliers and missing data; data visualization and analysis in support of data cleansing activities. * Understand different information architectures, data types, and data structures. * Understand relational and non-relational database design and querying. * Cover relevant ethical issues including data privacy and misinformation.\n\n\nProgram Learning Outcomes addressed by the course:\n\nBusiness Understanding. Apply frameworks and processes to build out data analytics solutions from understanding of business goals.\nData Culture. Embody and champion the highest standards for the ethical and moral use of data; understand issues related to data privacy and data security.\nSolid foundational data programming skills, using industry standard tools, essential algorithms, and design patterns for working with structured data, unstructured data and big data.\nData understanding. Collect, describe, model, explore and verify data.\nData preparation. Selecting, cleaning, constructing, integrating, and formatting data.\n\n\n\nHow is this course relevant for data analytics professionals?\nMost data analytics professionals spend most of their time getting data and preparing it for analysis. This is the course that teaches these key skills, as we work with both structured and unstructured data.\n\n\nGrading\n\nMeetup Reflections (10%)\nLabs (50%)\nTidyVerse Recipes\nProject (30%)\n\n\nGrade Distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuality of Performance\nLetter Grade\nRange %\nGPA\n\n\n\n\nExcellent - work is of exceptional quality\nA\n93 - 100\n4\n\n\nExcellent\nA-\n90 - 92.9\n3.7\n\n\nGood - work is above average\nB+\n87 - 89.9\n3.3\n\n\nSatisfactory\nB\n83 - 86.9\n3\n\n\nBelow Average\nB-\n80 - 82.9\n2.7\n\n\nPoor\nC+\n77 - 79.9\n2.3\n\n\nPoor\nC\n70 - 76.9\n2\n\n\nFailure\nF\n&lt; 70\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow This Course Works\nThis course is conducted entirely online. Each week, you will have various resources made available, including weekly readings from the textbooks and occasionally additional readings provided by the instructor. Most weeks will have homework assignments and labs to be submitted (although some chapters will take more than one week, see the schedule for details). There will also be a presentation required and a forum post introduction required. You are expected to complete all assignments by their due dates.\nYou are expected to attend or watch every Meetup. I highly recommend attending the Meetups live if possible but understand that may not be possible for everyone. Recordings will be made available by the next morning on the Meetups page. In addition to highlighting key concepts from each learning module, some topics will be discussed that are not in the textbook. Moreover, we regularly make announcements in the Meetups that will be important to being successful in this course. At the end of each Meetup there will be a short reflective exercise. These will contribute to your participation grade.\nThe culmination of the course will be the presentation of the analysis of a dataset of your choosing. See the project for more information.\n\n\nTextbooks and Course Materials\n\nR for Data Science (2e) by Hadley Wickham, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund.

    "text": "Overview\nThis projects involves data collection, creating a normalized SQL database representing the data you collected, and then loading the data from the SQL database into R.\n\n\nProblems\nProblem 1:\nSelect at least six popular movies that the people you will survey have a good chance of having watched. Ask at least five people that you know (friends, family, classmates, imaginary friends if necessary) to rate each of these movies that they have seen on a scale of 1 to 5. You may use online survey software if you find it easier and want to generate a larger sample.\nProblem 2:\nTake the results(observations) and store them in a SQL database of your choosing. I recommend SQLite or duckDB if you are undecided. Describe the normalization scheme you selected for your database and explain why you chose it.\nProblem 3:\nLoad the information from the SQL database into an R dataframe. This is by design a very open-ended assignment. In general, there’s no need here to ask “Can I…?” questions about your proposed approach. A variety of reasonable approaches are acceptable. You could for example access the SQL data directly from R, or you could create an intermediate .CSV file. I should be able to generate the SQL table(s) and data from your provided code—if you use a graphical user interface to create and populate tables, it should have a mechanism to generate corresponding SQL code. This assignment does not need to be 100% reproducible. You can (and should) blank out your SQL password if your solution requires it; otherwise, full credit requires that your code is “reproducible,” with the assumption that I have the same database server and R software. Handling missing data is a foundational skill when working with SQL or R. To receive full credit, you should demonstrate a reasonable approach for handling missing data. After all, how likely is it that all five of your friends have seen all six movies?\nProblem 4: Is there any benefit in standardizing ratings? How might you approach this?\n(Optional) Reading related to this assignment:\n\nJames Le, “The 4 Recommendation Engines That Can Predict Your Movie Tastes”, May 1, 2018. This a nice backgrounder on movie recommendation engines.\nSteve Blank, “The Customer Development Process. 2 Minutes to See Why”, Jul 29, 2014.. In this [&lt;3 minute] YouTube video “lean startup” founder Steve Blank talks about the importance of getting out of the building to talk to customers. I’d encourage you to adopt this “builder mentality” in your own data science work whenever it’s practical, by collecting data yourself, whether it’s related to a “business experiment” or a “scientific experiment.”"

For this project you need to select data that comes from multiple sources (there should be at least two datasets). You should be able to access the data and it should be large enough and contain enough variables so that multiple interesting relationships can be explored. A good starting point is that across your dataset, there should be at least 50 observations and more than 10 variables (exceptions can be made but you must speak with me first). The dataset’s variables should include categorical variables, discrete numerical variables, and continuous numerical variables.\nNote on reusing datasets from class: Do not reuse datasets used in examples, homework assignments, or labs in the class. Also do not use datasets exclusively from Kaggle or other sources of curated data for data science competitions (these have been made clean and tidy already).\nBelow are a list of data repositories that might be of interest to browse.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Overview\nFor this laboratory assignment you will perform an exploratory data analysis on a subset of data from the Stanford Open Policing dataset. The particular subset we will be focused on is a record of stops made by the Rhode Island State Patrol between 2005 and 2015. This dataset is contained in the file RIOpenPolicing.rds . The rds file format is a compressed format that is much smaller than the corresponding csv file. You can load the data from it using the function read_rds.\n\n\nProblems\nProblem 1: The first step of an exploratory data analysis is to think of a set of interesting questions that your data set might be able to answer. This dataset has a large number of variables, so your questions can help you narrow down the questions you might be interested in. Write down a few questions about police stops that you might be interested in and list the rows in the dataset that you think might have important information to answer your question.\nThis is intentionally open ended, but if you need inspiration you could look at how factors like time of day, month, race and gender (of both the officer and subject), or department id are related to the frequency of stops, the reason for stops, or the outcome. For example one interesting question might be: Do racial differences in traffic stops decrease at night?\nProblem 2: Having identified the most important variables, you should study their variability, in order to better understand their distribution and to identify any potential problems with the data quality or unusual values. Calculate summary statistics as appropriate for whether you have categorical or numerical data and perform basic visualizations. Give justifications for the visualizations that you selected.\nProblem 3: You likely found that for some of your variables there were missing data, outlier values, or data points that indicate some sort of error. In order to continue with your analysis you will need to decide what to do with these. Modify your dataset appropriately so that you will be able to perform an analysis of the relationships you are interested in. In addition to the code, give justifications for your choices.\nProblem 4: Now it is time to visualize the relationships that you are interested in. Make plots showing how variables co-vary, faceting when necessary to explore relationships among up to 3 variables. Consier the following questions when you observe a pattern:\n\nCould this pattern be due to coincidence (i.e. random chance)?\nHow can you describe the relationship implied by the pattern?\nHow strong is the relationship implied by the pattern?\nWhat other variables might affect the relationship?\nDoes the relationship change if you look at individual subgroups of the data?\n\nIf the results of these initial visualizations inspire more questions, consider performing those as well. Briefly summarize the results of this exercise and relate it to your initial questions and hypotheses."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Overview\nThis is a two part assignment. In the first part you will use the webscraping package rvest along with functions and iteration to download data from the internet on political contributions. In the second part, you will use httr to interact with the New York Times website apis.\n\n\nWebscraping Open Secrets\nIn this assignment we will scrape and work with data foreign connected PACs that donate to US political campaigns. In the United States, only American citizens and green card holders can contribute to federal elections, but the American divisions of foreign companies can form political action committees (PACs) and collect contributions from their American employees.\nFirst, we will get data foreign connected PAC contributions in the 2022 election cycle. Then, you will use a similar approach to get data such contributions from previous years so that we can examine trends over time.\nIn order to complete this assignment you will need a Chrome browser with the Selector Gadget extension installed.\nIn addition to tidyverse, you will need to install and load the packages robotstxt, rvest, and scales.\nProblem 1: Check that open secrets allows you to webscrape by running the paths_allowed function on the url https://www.opensecrets.org. Then write a function called scrape_pac() that scrapes information from the Open Secrets webpage for foreign connected PAC contributions in a given year:\n\nThis function should take the url of the webpage as its only input and should output a data frame\nIt should rename scraped variables using the “snake_case” naming convention\nclean up the Country of Origin/Parent Company variable with str_squish().\nadd a new column to the data frame for year. We will want this information when we ultimately have data from all years, so this is a good time to keep track of it. Our function doesn’t take a year argument, but the year is embedded in the URL, so we can extract it out of there, and add it as a new column. Use the str_sub() function to extract the last 4 characters from the URL. You will probably want to look at the help for this function to figure out how to specify “last 4 characters”.\n\nDefine the URLs for 2022, 2020, and 2000 contributions. Then, test your function using these URLs as inputs. Does the function seem to do what you expected it to do?\nProblem 2: Construct a vector called urls that contains the URLs for each webpage that contains information on foreign-connected PAC contributions for a given year. Map the scrape_pac() function over urls in a way that will result in a data frame called pac_all. Write the data frame to a csv file called pac-all.csv in the data folder.\nProblem 3: Clean your downloaded data file for visualization.\n\nFirst report the number of observations and variables that your scraped datasset contains.\nSeparate the country_parent into two such that country and parent company appear in different columns for country-level analysis.\nConvert contribution amounts in total, dems, and repubs from character strings to numeric values.\nPrint out the top 10 rows of your data frame after completing these steps.\n\nProblem 4: Create a line plot of total contributions from all foreign-connected PACs in the Canada and Mexico over the years. Once you have made the plot, write a brief interpretation of what the graph reveals. Few hints to help you out:\nProblem 5: Create a line plot of contributions from UK companies to each of the Democratic and Republican parties over time, with the lines colored according to party to differentiate them.\n\n\nUsing the NY Times API\nProblem 6: The New York Times web site provides a rich set of APIs, as described here . You’ll need to start by signing up for an API key. Your task is to choose one of the New York Times APIs, construct an interface in R to read in the JSON data, and transform it into an R DataFrame."

    "title": "Lab 4: Data Transformations Studying College Majors",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The first step in the process of turning information into knowledge process is to summarize and describe the raw information - the data. In this assignment we explore data on college majors and earnings, specifically the data begin the FiveThirtyEight story “The Economic Guide To Picking A College Major”.\nThese data originally come from the American Community Survey (ACS) 2010-2012 Public Use Microdata Series. While this is outside the scope of this assignment, if you are curious about how raw data from the ACS were cleaned and prepared, see the code FiveThirtyEight authors used.\nWe should also note that there are many considerations that go into picking a major. Earnings potential and employment prospects are two of them, and they are important, but they don’t tell the whole story. Keep this in mind as you analyze the data.\nWe’ll use the tidyverse package for much of the data wrangling and visualisation, the scales package for better formatting of labels on visualisations, and the data lives in the fivethirtyeight package. Make sure to install and load these packages if you don’t have them already. When you load ‘fivethirtyeight’ you gain access to a dataset called college_recent_grads, which is what your homework will be based on.\nThe college_recent_grads data frame is a trove of information. Let’s think about some questions we might want to answer with these data:\n\nWhich major has the lowest unemployment rate?\nWhich major has the highest percentage of women?\nHow do the distributions of median income compare across major categories?\nDo women tend to choose majors with lower or higher earnings?\n\nIn the next section we aim to answer these questions.\n\nProblems\nProblem 1 Arrange the data by unemployment rate in ascending order in order find the major with the lowest unemployment rate. Hint 1: Use the select function to reduce the number of variables displayed when you sort so that it is easier for you to see the answer. Hint 2: to reduce the number of digits displayed in the unemployment rate, use the percent() function to mutate the unemployment rate, i.e. pipe your output to mutate(unemployment_rate = percent(unemployment_rate) )\nProblem 2: Which major has the highest percentage of women? Determine the three majors with the highest percentage of women using arrange. Again use select to only display variables relevant to the question and pipe the final output to top_n(3) to display just the top 3 majors.\nProblem 3 This problem explores the distribution of median income across different majors.\n\nPlot the distribution of median income using a histogram. Make sure to experiment with the bin width to ensure that your histogram captures the most important features of the distribution.\nSummary statistics: calculate the mean, median, 25th and 75th quantiles of the median income distribution using the summarise function. Qualitatively describe the distribution (shape, center, spread, and any unusual observations).\nPlot the distribution of median income for each value of the major_category variable using facets. Use group_by, summarise, and arrange to determine which major category has the highest typical median income, where “typical” comes from the summary statistic that you think best describes the distributions you observed in the histogram.\n\nProblem 4: Which major category is the least popular in this sample? Use the count function along with arrange to accomplish this task, and make sure you arrange in ascending order.\nProblem 5: Exploring differences between different STEM fields.\nOne of the sections of the FiveThirtyEight story is “All STEM fields aren’t the same”.\nThe STEM categories are the ones that match the vector\n\nc(\n  \"Biology & Life Science\",\n  \"Computers & Mathematics\",\n  \"Engineering\",\n  \"Physical Sciences\")\n\nUse this vector to add a variable to your dataset that is True if the major is a STEM major and FALSE otherwise. Then determine the STEM majors which have median salaries equal to or less than the median for all majors’ median earnings. Your output should only show the major name and median, 25th and 75th percentile earnings, and should be sorted in descending order of median income.\nProblem 6: What types of majors do women tend to major in? Create a scatterplot of median income vs. proportion of women in that major, coloured by whether the major is in a STEM field or not. Describe the association between these three variables."

Be sure to install R and RStudio on your own computers within the first few days of the class.\n\nR - download for Windows, Mac, or Linux.\nRStudio - Download Windows, Mac, or Linux versions from here\n\nIf using Windows, you also need to download RTools.\n\n\nLaTeX\n\nLaTeX is a typesetting language for preparing documents. Documents are written in plain text files. Formatting the document is done using specific markup. If you have used HTML, the framework is similar however instead of using &lt;TAG&gt;&lt;/TAG&gt; syntax, LaTeX uses \\TAG{} format. We will primarily use Markdown, and its extension R Markdown for preparing documents in this class. However, when preparing PDF documents, the Markdown will first be converted to LaTeX before creating the PDF file. As such, a LaTeX converter is necessary. There are LaTeX installers for Windows (MiKTeX) and Mac (BasicTeX). Alternatively, the tinytex R package provides an easier way of installing LaTeX directly from within R:\n\ninstall.packages('tinytex')\ntinytex::install_tinytex()\n\n\n\nSource Control\nAll course materials will be made available on Github which provides an implementation of the git open source version control system. RStudio supports git directly, but I recommend downloading Sourcetree. This is a free desktop client that provides an easier interface for working with Github. You will also need to create an account on Github.\nFor more information, Jenny Bryan’s Happy Git and Github for the useR is a free online book covering the important features of source control for R users.\n\n\nR Packages\n\nOnce everything is installed, execute the following command in RStudio to install the packages we will use for this class (you can copy-and-paste):\n\ninstall.packages(c('openintro','devtools','tidyverse', 'ggplot2',\n                   'psych','reshape2','knitr','markdown','shiny','R.rsp',\n                   'fivethirtyeight'))",
