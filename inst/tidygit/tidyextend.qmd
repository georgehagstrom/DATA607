# Overview


In this assignment, you’ll practice collaborating around a code project with GitHub. You could consider our collective work as building out a book of examples on how to use TidyVerse functions. 

GitHub repository: [https://github.com/georgehagstrom/Fall2024TIDYVERSE](https://github.com/georgehagstrom/Fall2024TIDYVERSE)



Your task here is to Extend an Existing Example. Using one of your classmate’s examples (as created above), extend his or her example with additional annotated code.

You should clone the provided repository. Once you have code to submit, you should make a pull request on the shared repository. You should also update the README.md file with your example.

After you’ve extended your classmate's vignette, please submit your GitHub handle name on brightspace.

You should complete your submission on the schedule stated in the course syllabus.
